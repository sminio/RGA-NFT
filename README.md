# Welcome to the RGA-NFT Dapp

This Dapp allows you to generate new random artworks.

During the verifiable random artwork generation a NFT is minted to prove your ownership of the artwork.

If you want you can transfer the ownership of your rga-NFTs.

You can also view all existing rga-NFTs.

But __before__ all of that is possible make sure you have completed the following steps:

1. Install [Metamask Browser Extension](https://metamask.io/) and create your wallet. 

2. Connect to Kovan Testnet

3. Get yourself [Kovan Test Ether](https://faucet.kovan.network/)

4. Connect your wallet to this Dapp
